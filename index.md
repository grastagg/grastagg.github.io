# Hi, I'm Grant Stagg

I'm a PhD student in Electrical & Computer Engineering at Brigham Young University, part of the [MAGICC Lab](https://magicc.byu.edu/). My research focuses on **safe path planning and learning in uncertain, adversarial environments**, with applications in UAV navigation, radar avoidance, and probabilistic engagement zone modeling.

I'm currently seeking industry or research roles related to UAV autonomy, optimization, or safety in adversarial systems.
