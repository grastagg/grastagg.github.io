# 👋 Hi, I'm Grant Stagg

I'm a PhD student in Electrical & Computer Engineering at Brigham Young University, working in the [MAGICC Lab](https://magicc.byu.edu/). I build algorithms for **safe path planning and learning in uncertain, adversarial environments**, with applications in UAV navigation, radar avoidance, and engagement zone modeling.

## 🔬 Current Research

- 🛡️ **Probabilistic Engagement Zones (PEZ)**  
  I study how to represent and infer weapon engagement zones when the pursuer’s capabilities (e.g., location, heading, turn rate, speed) are uncertain. My work includes the Curve–Straight Probabilistic Engagement Zone (CSPEZ), a geometric and probabilistic model that enables safe planning and adversarial inference.

- 🧭 **Trajectory Optimization and Path Planning**  
  I develop algorithms for generating minimum-time, safe, and kinematically feasible paths in uncertain and contested environments. I use B-splines, JAX-based autodiff, and IPOPT-based constrained optimization to plan UAV trajectories that avoid radar, engagement zones, and dynamic threats.

- 📡 **Radar-Avoidance and Threat Inference**  
  I work on inferring adversary radar or weapon system parameters from sparse or noisy engagement data. I use learning-based and Bayesian inference methods to estimate hidden parameters (like location or range) from observed paths and outcomes, and use this information to plan low-risk trajectories.

- 🤖 **Learning from Sacrificial Agents**  
  I design algorithms that use exploratory "sacrificial" UAVs to learn engagement parameters safely. These methods combine active learning, probabilistic modeling, and optimal experimental design to accelerate inference without compromising high-priority mission agents.
