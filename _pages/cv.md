## Summary

I am a PhD student in Electrical Engineering at Brigham Young University, focusing on uncertainty-aware UAV path planning and probabilistic modeling in adversarial environments. My work blends control theory, multi-agent coordination, and trajectory optimization for applications such as radar avoidance, environmental mapping, and real-time estimation.
